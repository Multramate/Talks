\section{Overview}

\begin{frame}{Overview: definitions}

Elliptic curves in \texttt{Mathlib/AlgebraicGeometry/EllipticCurve} are defined in terms of Weierstrass curves over a commutative ring $ R $.

\begin{definition}[\texttt{WeierstrassCurve} in \texttt{Weierstrass.lean}]
A \textbf{Weierstrass curve} $ W_R $ is a tuple $ (a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_6) \in R^5 $.

An \textbf{elliptic curve} $ E_R $ is a Weierstrass curve such that $ \Delta(a_i) \in R^\times $.
\end{definition}

Their points are defined via the affine model.

\begin{definition}[\texttt{WeierstrassCurve.Affine.Point} in \texttt{Affine.lean}]
An \textbf{affine point} of $ W_R $ is a pair $ (x, y) \in R^2 $ such that $ W(x, y) = 0 $ and either $ W_X(x, y) \ne 0 $ or $ W_Y(x, y) \ne 0 $, where
$$ W := Y^2 + a_1XY + a_3Y - (X^3 + a_2X^2 + a_4X^3 + a_6). $$

The \textbf{points} $ W_R(R) $ are the affine points of $ W_R $ and a point at infinity.
\end{definition}

\section{Group law}

\begin{frame}{Group law: theorem}

\begin{theorem}[in \texttt{Group.lean}]
If $ F $ is a field, then $ W_F(F) $ is an abelian group under an addition law.
\end{theorem}

\bigskip Elementary proofs of associativity:
\begin{itemize}
\item polynomial manipulation via \texttt{ring}
\item geometric argument via B\'ezout's theorem
\end{itemize}
Proofs by identification with known groups:
\begin{itemize}
\item a quotient $ \C / \Lambda $ of the complex numbers by a lattice
\item the group of degree-zero Weil divisors $ \Pic^0(W_F) $
\item the ideal class group $ \Cl(F[W_F]) $ of the coordinate ring
\end{itemize}
Junyan gave an pure algebraic proof via norms.

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Group law: formalisation}

Define
$$ \functions[\phi]{W_F(F)}{\Cl(F[W_F])}{0}{[(1)]}{(x, y)}{[(X - x, Y - y)]}. $$
Note that $ F[W_F] $ is a free algebra over $ F[X] $ with basis $ \{1, Y\} $, so it has a norm given by $ \Nm(p + qY) = \det([\cdot(p + qY)]) $. On one hand,
$$ \deg(\Nm(p + qY)) = \max(2\deg(p), 2\deg(q) + 3) \ne 1. $$
On the other hand, $ F[W_F] / (p + qY) \cong F[X] / (p) \oplus F[X] / (q) $, so
$$ \deg(\Nm(p + qY)) = \deg(pq) = \dim(F[W_F] / (p + qY)). $$
Thus if $ (X - x, Y - y) = (p + qY) $, then
$$ F[W_F] / (p + qY) = F[X, Y] / (W(X, Y), X - x, Y - y) \cong F, $$
which contradicts $ \dim(F[W_F] / (p + qY)) \ne 1 $.

\end{frame}

\section{Torsion subgroup}

\begin{frame}{Torsion subgroup: theorem}

\begin{theorem}[in \texttt{Torsion.lean}]
If $ F $ is a field where $ n \ne 0 $, then $ E_F(\overline{F})[n] \cong (\Z / n\Z)^2 $.
\end{theorem}

\bigskip Some standard proofs:
\begin{itemize}
\item identification with $ (\C / \Lambda)[n] $
\item induced map of isogenies on $ \Pic^0(E_{\overline{F}}) $
\item existence of polynomials $ \psi_n, \phi_n, \omega_n \in \overline{F}[X, Y] $ such that
$$ [n](x, y) = \left(\dfrac{\phi_n(x)}{\psi_n(x)^2}, \dfrac{\omega_n(x, y)}{\psi_n(x, y)^3}\right) $$
and a proof that $ \deg(\psi_n^2) = n^2 - 1 $
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Torsion subgroup: formalisation}

The latter proof turned out to be incredibly tricky.
\begin{itemize}
\item The identity holds in the universal ring $ \Z[A_i, X, Y] / (W) $, so needs a specialisation map or projective coordinates
\item The definition of $ \psi_n $ is strong even-odd recursive with five base cases and an awkward even case, so proofs are very lengthy
\item The definition of $ \omega_n $ is very elusive, and seemingly involves division by two in characteristic two
\item The polynomials $ \phi_n $ and $ \psi_n^2 $ are bivariate, so needs a conversion to univariate polynomials for degree computations
\item The identity cannot be proven directly via induction, and needs elliptic divisibility sequences and elliptic nets
\end{itemize}
These have been formalised in \texttt{Projective.lean}, \texttt{Jacobian.lean}, \texttt{DivisionPolynomial/*.lean}, and \texttt{Universal.lean}. These also use lemmas in \texttt{Algebra/Polynomial/Bivariate.lean} and \texttt{NumberTheory/EllipticDivisibilitySequence.lean}
